			<p>How do I review the business terms?</p>
			<p>Login to https://gwu.collibra.com
		Use the browser on the dashboard to select your community.  Such as: Academics/Course Management/Course Management Terms.
		Use the Filter to define what set of data you would like to see.
		For example if I only want to see business terms.  I would select in the filter editor “type” equals “Business Term” and if I only want to see those business terms that are in candidate status. I would add in the next filter editor line “status” equals “candidate”.  Then select “Filter” to apply the rules.  Now you will see only Business Terms that are in candidate status within your community.</p>
